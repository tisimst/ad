Description: Overview
        ========
        The ``ad`` package allows you to **easily** and **transparently** perform 
        **first and second-order automatic differentiation**. Advanced math 
        involving trigonometric, logarithmic, hyperbolic, etc. functions can also 
        be evaluated directly using the ``admath`` sub-module.
        
        `Automatic differentiation`_ is different from numerical and symbolic
        differentiation in that it uses prior knowledge of how derivatives 
        are calculated, `but that's the part you don't need to worry about 
        while using this package`. They are then transmitted through subsequent 
        calculations (using the generalized `chain rule`_).
        
        Basic examples
        ==============
        ::
        
            >>> from ad import AD
        
            >>> x = AD(2.0)
            >>> x
            ADV(2.0)
        
            >>> square = x**2
            >>> square
            ADF(4.0)
            >>> square.d(x)  # get the first derivative wrt x
            4.0
            >>> square.d2(x)  # get the second derivative wrt x
            2.0
        
            >>> from ad.admath import *  # sin, cos, log, exp, sqrt, etc.
            >>> sin(1 + x**2)
            ADF(-0.958924274663)
        
            >>> print (2*x + 1000).d()  # no inputs shows dict of all derivatives
            {ADV(2.0): 2.0}
        
            >>> y = AD(3, tag='y')  # tags are useful for tracking original variables
            >>> y
            y(3.0)
            >>> y.d(x)  # returns zero if the derivative doesn't exist
            0.0
        
            >>> z = x*y**2
            >>> z
            ADF(18.0)
            >>> z.gradient([x, y])  # show the gradient in the order given
            [9.0, 12.0]
            >>> z.d2c(x, y)  # second cross-derivatives, order doesn't matter -> (x,y) or (y,x)
            6.0
            >>> z.hessian([x, y])
            [[0.0, 6.0], [6.0, 4.0]]
        
            >>> import numpy as np  # most numpy functions work out of the box
            >>> arr = np.array(AD([1, 2, 3]))  # multiple input support
            >>> arr.sum()
            ADF(6.0)
            >>> arr.max()
            ADV(3.0)
            >>> arr.mean()
            ADF(2.0)
            >>> arr.var()  # array variance
            ADF(0.666666666667)
            >>> sqrt(arr)  # vectorized operations supported with ad operators
            array([ADF(1.0), ADF(1.41421356237), ADF(1.73205080757)], dtype=object)
        
        Main Features
        =============
        
        - **Transparent calculations with derivatives: no or little 
          modification of existing code** is needed, including when using
          the `Numpy`_ module. The only function (that I have tested, and I 
          certainly haven't tested most of them) that doesn't work right 
          out of the box is ``numpy.std`` since it internally calls its 
          builtin ``sqrt`` function. Two alternatives exist to work around 
          this: 1) use ``**0.5`` or 2) using the ``admath.sqrt`` 
          operator.
        - **Almost all mathematical operations** are supported, including
          functions from the standard `math`_ module (sin, cos, exp, erf, 
          etc.) with additional convenience trigonometric, hyperbolic, 
          and logarithmic functions (csc, acoth, ln, etc.). Comparison 
          operators follow the same rules as ``float`` types.
        - Nearly all derivative calculations are performed **analytically**
          (only the ``gamma`` and ``lgamma`` functions use a high-accuracy 
          finite difference formula).
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You have several easy, convenient options to install the ``ad`` package 
        (administrative privileges may be required)
        
        1. Download the package files below, unzip to any directory, and run 
           ``python setup.py install`` from the command-line
        2. Simply copy the unzipped ``ad-XYZ`` directory to any other location 
           that python can find it and rename it ``ad``
        3. If ``setuptools`` is installed, run ``easy_install --upgrade ad`` 
           from the command-line
        4. If ``pip`` is installed, run ``pip --upgrade ad`` from the command-line
